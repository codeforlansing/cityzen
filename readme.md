# Introduction

Welcome to CityZen, a volunteer management program. We've built CityZen for The Fledge. The Fledge describes itself as “a one-of-a-kind radically inclusive Ideation Space, Maker Space, Incubator and Accelerator on a mission to create opportunities to pursue happiness.” They work with two types of volunteers, people who are active in one of their projects and parolees fulfilling a community service commitment mandated by the court.

CityZen allows people to volunteer for both a specific project and a specific task on the group's website. The Fledge staff setup a project in Trello and list the tasks required. They can drag or drop the project cards in the order they want them to appear on their website.

Volunteers then click on a project task and a window pops up that captures their email. Cityzen itself operates both in the background as well as supplying a reporting component. The group receives an email and schedules an appointment for the volunteer. If it's a new volunteer and the group is using either HubSpot or MailChimp their contact information will be added.
