## Setup for developers
### Running the cityzen-server locally
The cityzen-server can be started locally in two ways:
#### Run as a docker container
- A funtioning docker environment with docker compose is required
    - install docker engine [Docker Engine documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
    - install docker-compose [Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
##### On a linux workstation
- docker requires root privilegs either as the root user, using sudo, or the use of a [docker group](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user)
- in a terminal navigate to the docker/development subdirectory of the local [cityzen-server git repository](https://github.com/codeforlansing/cityzen-server)
- start the server using docker-compose with sudo if needed
    - `docker-compose up`  
    - `sudo docker-compose up` 
- Currently tested on Ubuntu 20.04
