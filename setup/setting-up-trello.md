Now we're ready to create 'cards' which in Trello which will represent your projects.  In each project you can list individual tasks.  Trello calls the card titles lists. So creating a list is naming a card.  Then you're asked to add a card which is what Trello calls adding a task.

By grabbing the titles of the cards you can drag them around to change their order.  So if you have a new project and want it to be first on your web page drag it to first in Trello and it will be reflected on your website.
